# Exploring-SQL-Injection-Identification-Exploitation-and-Defense-Mechanisms
This project focuses on analyzing SQL injection attacks, a prevalent threat to web application security. It explores how SQL injection exploits vulnerabilities in web applications, demonstrates attack techniques, and evaluates various mitigation strategies. The study includes practical examples, real-life case studies, and discusses the effectiveness of methods like input validation, output sanitization, and the use of security tools such as Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) to protect databases from unauthorized access and manipulation.
